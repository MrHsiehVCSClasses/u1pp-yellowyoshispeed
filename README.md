Welcome to your first programming project!

For each programming project after this one, the `README.md` will contain all the instructions that you will need. 

## Goal

This programming project was mostly about setting up your development environment. 

Good news: if you have downloaded this, you are almost done!

The final part of this programming project is simply to teach you the general flow of your programming projects.

You only need to make a few small changes to the code of this project so that it passes all the automated tests. 

## Instructions

1. Run the automated tests, and observe that there are failures.
2. Go into the code and try to fix the failures, based on the error messages.
3. Add, commit, and push your changes. **NOTE**: only pushed changes will graded

## Grading Breakdown

* Code compiles & runs without errors: 1 pts
* Formatting/indentation: 2 points
* All code commented: 2 points
* No public methods/attributes besides the ones specified: 2 point
* All code is DRY (Don't repeat yourself): 3 points
* Passes all test cases: 20 points
  
Total: 30 points
